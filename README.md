# ðŸ§† Felafel

Felafel (aka, the **Fel**inesoft **A**gile **F**ront-**E**nd **L**ibrary) is a set of basic components and layouts built according to the [Felinesoft front-end standards](http://querkmachine.github.io/FSFrontEndDocs/) and compatible with [Kickstart8](https://github.com/querkmachine/kickstart8), the front-end framework used across all web projects starting from 2020.

## Current state

In lieu of a demo or significant documentation at this time, examples of components and layouts are located in the `demo/` folder of the package. Iâ€™ve started to write fuller documentation and a more comprehensive example implementation (with them being the same thing to be extra fancy), but theyâ€™re far from ready.

## Installing Felafel

The project is set up a bit differently to others as Iâ€™ve made it in the style of an npm package. I did this because packages are generally a lot easier to work with than submodules, which ought to be useful for rapid prototyping and building demos.

### Using precompiled files

If little to no customisation is necessary, you can copy the precompiled files from the `dist` folder or reference them directly in HTML.

```
<!-- In the page's <head> element -->
<link ref="stylesheet" href="path-to-felafel/dist/all.css">

<!-- Above the page's closing <body> tag -->
<script src="path-to-felafel/dist/all.js"></script>
<script>window.fs.initAll();</script>
```

## Using Felafel

Felafel makes heavy use of several modern features introduced into the Sass language, such as the module system. Felafel **requires Dart Sass version 1.33.0 or higher** as a result and will not work with Node or Ruby versions of Sass, nor older versions of Dart Sass.

Felafel is built in a (mostly) modular way, and is most powerful when used alongside Sass. Using Sass itâ€™s possible to only import certain components or styles into a project:

```
// We want all of this
@use "node_modules/fs-felafel/src/scss/core";

// Some useful mixins here
@use "node_modules/fs-felafel/src/scss/helpers/typography";

// Want this too
@use "node_modules/fs-felafel/src/scss/components/step-indicator";
```

Alternatively, get everything:

```
@use "node_modules/fs-felafel/src/scss/all";
```

How you implement Sass can be as simple or complex as necessary. It can be a terminal command, an npm script, or part of a whole Gulpwebpackbrowserify build processâ€”Felafel doesnâ€™t care.

### Usage tips

- Felafel is utilitarian as a default. Out of the box itâ€™s black and white, uses system fonts, and only supports up to four columns. It tries to not be too assuming, whilst still working to maintain some consistency.
- Felafel has a lot of override classes. If a bit of spacing looks weird, you want to change the size of this one heading, or put all this text in a big red box without making a whole new component for it, you can do that with overrides.
- Forms are expected to take up about two-thirds of the container width (by the default definitions of those). You can go wider if you want, but inputs tend to start looking a bit weird if you do.
