            The Old English word for bread was <em>hlaf</em> (<em>hlaifs</em> in
            Gothic: modern English <em>loaf</em>), which appears to be the
            oldest Teutonic name. Old High German <em>hleib</em> and modern
            German <em>Laib</em> derive from this Proto-Germanic word, which was
            borrowed into Slavic (Polish <em>chleb</em>, Russian <em>khleb</em>)
            and Finnic (Finnish <em>leipä</em>, Estonian <em>leib</em>)
            languages as well. The Middle and Modern English word bread appears
            in Germanic languages, such as West Frisian <em>brea</em>, Dutch
            <em>brood</em>, German <em>Brot</em>, Swedish <em>bröd</em>, and
            Norwegian and Danish <em>brød</em>; it may be related to
            <em>brew</em> or perhaps to <em>break</em>, originally meaning
            "broken piece", "morsel".

              In wheat, phenolic compounds are mainly found in hulls in the form
              of insoluble bound ferulic acid, where it is relevant to wheat
              resistance to fungal diseases.

              can be found in commercial breads containing flaxseed.

              Bread can be served at many temperatures; once baked, it can
              subsequently be toasted. It is most commonly eaten with the hands,
              either by itself or as a carrier for other foods. Bread can be
              spread with butter, dipped into liquids such as gravy, olive oil,
              or soup; it can be topped with various sweet and savory spreads,
              or used to make sandwiches containing meats, cheeses, vegetables,
              and condiments.

              Nutritionally, bread is categorized as a source of grains in the
              food pyramid. Further, it is a good source of carbohydrates and
              nutrients such as magnesium, iron, selenium, B vitamins, and
              dietary fiber.

              Bread crust is formed from surface dough during the cooking
              process. It is hardened and browned through the Maillard reaction
              using the sugars and amino acids due to the intense heat at the
              bread surface. The crust of most breads is harder, and more
              complexly and intensely flavored, than the rest. Old wives' tales
              suggest that eating the bread crust makes a person's hair curlier.
              Additionally, the crust is rumored to be healthier than the
              remainder of the bread. Some studies have shown that this is true
              as the crust has more dietary fiber and antioxidants such as
              pronyl-lysine, which is being researched for its potential
              colorectal cancer inhibitory properties.
