      Bread is one of the oldest prepared foods. Evidence from 30,000 years ago
      in Europe and Australia revealed starch residue on rocks used for pounding
      plants. It is possible that during this time, starch extract from the
      roots of plants, such as cattails and ferns, was spread on a flat rock,
      placed over a fire and cooked into a primitive form of flatbread.

    <p class="fs-body">
      The world's oldest evidence of bread-making has been found in a
      14,500-year-old Natufian site in Jordan's northeastern desert. Around
      10,000 BC, with the dawn of the Neolithic age and the spread of
      agriculture, grains became the mainstay of making bread. Yeast spores are
      ubiquitous, including on the surface of cereal grains, so any dough left
      to rest leavens naturally.

      There were multiple sources of leavening available for early bread.
      Airborne yeasts could be harnessed by leaving uncooked dough exposed to
      air for some time before cooking. Pliny the Elder reported that the Gauls
      and Iberians used the foam skimmed from beer called barm to produce "a
      lighter kind of bread than other peoples" such as barm cake. Parts of the
      ancient world that drank wine instead of beer used a paste composed of
      grape juice and flour that was allowed to begin fermenting, or wheat bran
      steeped in wine, as a source for yeast. The most common source of
      leavening was to retain a piece of dough from the previous day to use as a
      form of sourdough starter, as Pliny also reported.

      The Chorleywood bread process was developed in 1961; it uses the intense
      mechanical working of dough to dramatically reduce the fermentation period
      and the time taken to produce a loaf. The process, whose high-energy
      mixing allows for the use of grain with a lower protein content, is now
      widely used around the world in large factories. As a result, bread can be
      produced very quickly and at low costs to the manufacturer and the
      consumer. However, there has been some criticism of the effect on
      nutritional value.
