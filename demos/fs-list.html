        In a measuring jug, mix the sugar with 150ml/5fl oz of the warm water
        and yeast and let stand in a warm place for five minutes, or until
        frothy. If using fast-acting yeast, there is no need to let the mixture
        stand.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. Rub in the butter and make a
        well in the centre. (If using olive oil instead of butter, pour the
        olive oil into the remaining water.) Pour in the yeast mixture and most
        of the remaining water (and the olive oil, if using). Mix to a loose
        dough, adding the remaining water if needed, plus extra if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead for about ten minutes or until the dough is smooth and springy to
        the touch. (If kneading in an electric food mixer with a dough hook,
        five minutes is usually long enough.) Put the dough in a large oiled
        bowl. Cover the top tightly with cling film and place somewhere warm to
        rise until doubled in size. This may take up to two or even three hours.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.</li>
      <li>
        When the dough has more than doubled in size, knock back and knead again
        for 2–3 minutes. Leave to relax for ten minutes before you begin to
        shape the bread.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the bread into loaves or rolls, transfer to a baking tray and
        cover with a clean tea towel. Allow to rise again in a warm place for
        20–30 minutes, or until the shaped dough has again doubled in size. When
        fully risen, it should leave a dent when you gently press the dough with
        your finger.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently (as the bread is full of air at this point and therefore very
        fragile) brush with egg wash and sprinkle with poppy or sesame seeds (if
        using), or dust lightly with flour for a rustic-looking loaf.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the oven for 10–15 minutes for rolls, or 30–45 minutes for a
        loaf, depending on its size. Turn the heat down to 200C/400F/Gas 6 after
        15 minutes for the remaining cooking time. When cooked, the bread should
        sound hollow when tapped on the base. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
