      <h2>The principle of relativity</h2>
      <p class="fs-body-l">
        Principles of relativity address the relationship between observations
        made at different places. This problem has been a difficult theoretical
        challenge since the earliest times and involves physical questions such
        as how the velocities of objects can be combined and how influences are
        transmitted between moving objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most <em>fruitful</em> approaches to this problem was the
        investigation of
        <strong
          >how observations are affected by the velocity of the observer</strong
        >. This problem had been tackled by classical philosophers but it was
        the work of Galileo that produced a real breakthrough. Galileo (1632),
        in his <a href="#">Dialogues Concerning the Two Chief World Systems</a>,
        considered observations of motion made by people inside a ship who could
        not see the outside:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          have the ship proceed with any speed you like, so long as the motion
          is uniform and not fluctuating this way and that. You will discover
          not the least change in all the effects named, nor could you tell from
          any of them whether the ship was moving or standing still.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        According to Galileo, if the ship moved smoothly then someone inside it
        would be unable to determine whether they were moving. If people in
        Galileo's moving ship were eating dinner they would see their peas fall
        from their fork straight down to their plate in the same way as they
        might if they were at home on dry land. The peas move along with the
        people and do not appear to the diners to fall diagonally. This means
        that the peas continue in a state of uniform motion unless someone
        intercepts them or otherwise acts on them. It also means that simple
        experiments that the people on the ship might perform would give the
        same results on the ship or at home. This concept led to “Galilean
        Relativity” in which it was held that things continue in a state of
        motion unless acted upon and that the laws of physics are independent of
        the velocity of the laboratory.

      <h2>How to make falafel</h2>
      <p>
        You can make these easy falafels in minutes for a delicious quick

        It's a simplified falafel recipe for those on a budget with limited kit
        – it's so much cheaper than buying ready-made.
      </p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><del>14oz</del>/400g tin chickpeas</li>
        <li>2 spring onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zest only</li>
        <li>2 dessertspoons plain flour</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 tsp olive oil</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Method</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Put the chickpeas in a saucepan and mash with a potato masher until as
          smooth as possible. (If you have a non-stick pan, use a plastic masher
          to protect the coating.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the spring onions, cumin, lemon zest, flour and salt. Season with
          lots of black pepper and mix well with a wooden spoon.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using your hands, form the mixture into six equal-sized balls and
          flatten slightly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add 2 teaspoons of the oil to a frying pan over a low heat. Add the
          falafel and cook for 4 minutes. Flip onto the other side and add
          another 2 teaspoons of oil to the pan. Cook for a further 3–4 minutes,
          or until golden brown and crisp on both sides.
        </li>
      </ol>
